# as3-commons
Import of the google-code as3-commons repo from (https://code.google.com/archive/p/as3-commons/)

This repo will act as a intermediate repo in which as3-commons will we brought to shape prior to importing it as new sub-project to Apache Flex
 
Currently building the repo requires quite a number of third party libraries, which are not available in Maven central. Also a lot of tests will probably fail. I will concentrate on fixing the tests first. After that I'll try to find out how we cn get the missing artifacts to maven central.
