        <section name="Important Changes in v2.5">
             <ul>
                 <li>For performance reasons were changed the access to loggers,
                     instead of the former common: <pre class="source">logger.info("{0}*{0}={1}", 3, 9);</pre>
                     we now use the a lot faster syntax (performance-wise) 
                     <pre class="source">logger.info("{0}*{0}={1}", [3, 9]);</pre>
                     to make sure that you have the fastest logging at your finger
                     tips. We will publish within the next days a <code>.swc</code> which allows
                     you to use the api as you are used to for backwards compatibility.
                     To be offer this new backwards compatibility all the <code>.api</code> package
                     was introduced.

                 </li>
                 <li>
                     By default the logging framework does <strong>not</strong> render statements
                     to <code>trace</code> anymore. This has been made to ensure
                     that at deploy-time the logging consumes as few resources
                     as necessary.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     The former deprecated <code>LoggerFactory.getNamedLogger</code>
                     and <code>LoggerFactory.getLogger</code> have been dumped to
                     enforce our police of not keeping legacy code for too long.

                 <li>
                     The former suggested way of requesting a logger via
                     <code>LoggerFactory.getNamedLogger</code> was deprecated
                     in favor of <code>getLogger</code>
                 </li>
