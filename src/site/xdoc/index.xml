			<p>
				The AS3Commons project is dedicated to one principal goal: creating and
				maintaining reusable ActionScript? 3.0 components. This is a place
				for collaboration and sharing, where developers from throughout the
				community can work together on projects to be shared.
</p>
			<p>

				AS3Commons developers will make an effort to ensure that their components have
				minimal dependencies on other libraries, so that these components
				can be deployed easily. In addition, AS3Commons components will keep
				their interfaces as stable as possible, so that users (including
				other AS3Commons projects) can implement these components without
				having to worry about changes in the future.
</p>
			<p>
				We welcome participation from all that are interested, at all skill
				levels. Coding, documentation and testing are all critical parts of
				the software development process. If you are interested in
				participating in any of these aspects, please join us!
